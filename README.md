# Chest X-Ray Classification

This repository contains the implementation of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for classifying chest X-ray images into three categories: COVID-19, viral pneumonia, and healthy person. The CNN model is developed using TensorFlow and Keras, and it achieves exceptional accuracy in classifying chest X-ray images.

## Overview

The classification of chest X-ray images is crucial in diagnosing respiratory diseases, especially during pandemics like COVID-19. This project focuses on developing a reliable CNN model capable of accurately categorizing chest X-ray images into relevant classes. By leveraging deep learning techniques, we aim to improve the accuracy and robustness of the classification process.

## Results

The CNN model achieved an impressive accuracy of 95.45% on the test set, outperforming traditional machine learning methods. Through systematic experimentation, we identified key factors affecting model performance and emphasized the effectiveness of CNN models in classifying chest X-ray images.
